# Experiment No: 2c Multiplication Using Lambda Function

## AIM  
To write a Python program that defines a function using a lambda expression to multiply two numbers.

---

### ALGORITHM  
1. Begin the program.  
2. Use `input()` to read the two numbers `a` and `b` from the user.
3. Convert the inputs to integers.
4. Create a lambda function that takes two arguments `a` and `b`, and returns their multiplication `a * b`.
5. Assign the lambda function to a variable `f`.
6. Call the function `f(a, b)` to compute the multiplication and print the result.
7. Terminate the program.

### ðŸ§¾ PROGRAM

```python
a = int(input())
b = int(input())

f = lambda a, b: a * b
print(f(a, b))
```
